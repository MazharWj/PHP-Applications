		<h4 style="font-family:cursive; color:#3eaec2; font-size:19px;">The Teachers’ Resource Centre (TRC) has been established to support teachers in their ambitions to improve teaching and learning in the schools. All Head Office, Central Region Office and The Smart School–HO employees are members of the TRC.<p></br>
We are using the Library Management System (Library Software) to classify and catalogue TRC resources according to Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Anglo American Cataloguing Rules (AACR). DDC and AACR are international systems for libraries used all over the world.</p></br>
The TRC catalogue is now online. Members can search their required material by Subject, Author, Title etc. We have a collection of materials on School Management, Classroom Management, Leadership, Curriculum, Educational Research, Information Literacy, English and Urdu Language, Islam, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics and Arts.<p></br>
We also have two workstations with full internet access for research work.</p></br>
The Teachers’ Resource Centre is an influential and important place in the evolution of educational advancement.
