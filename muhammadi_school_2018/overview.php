		<h4 style="font-family:cursive; color:#3eaec2; font-size:19px;">Indeed, the education that the School provides, with its politically liberal ethos, enables its students to integrate within their home communities in Pakistan, as well as in the countries and communities abroad to which they ultimately bring their professional skills and expertise. Muhammadi School maintains a balance of Western and Asian best practice and, by so doing, provides a curriculum that meets the needs of children and young people in the modern world.<p></br>
Our philosophy aims to encourage students, in the best learning environments we are able to provide, to be confident, articulate, and actively engaged with the world around them. We want them to achieve their maximum academic and social potential, to be engaged and responsive learners – in other words, to be the best they can be. At the same time, the education we provide must enable our students to respond positively to the opportunities and challenges of the rapidly changing world – including the need to make the best of what they know and to keep on learning. Our students today must be prepared to engage with economic change, including the continued globalisation of the economy and society, and with the rapid expansion of communication technologies.</p></br>
Our education must also reaffirm our commitment to the traditional values – to the virtues of truth, justice, honesty, trust and a sense of duty. </h4></br></br></br>
